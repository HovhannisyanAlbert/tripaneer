        While La Cucina Sabina has put together a full schedule, there's plenty
        of time to enjoy each otherâ€™s company, have an optional massage, stroll
        the gardens, and olive or cherry groves, swim in the Olympic sized pool,
        enjoy the sauna, or just sip a glass of wine poolside or on one of the
        many terraces. While you are not fast paced, La Cucina Sabina does offer
        a full agenda.
